# Hospital Patient Registration and Appointment Management System

## Project Overview

This project models a **Hospital Patient Registration and Appointment Management System**, a healthcare delivery process that manages:

- Patient registration  
- Appointment scheduling  
- Doctor assignment  
- Treatment management  
- Billing

The system is designed to **analyze performance metrics** such as patient waiting time, doctor utilization, appointment throughput, and resource allocation. Using a real-world dataset, this project identifies bottlenecks and optimizes system efficiency.

## Dataset Description

The project uses the **Hospital Management Dataset** from Kaggle (by Kanak Baghel). It consists of the following CSV files:

| File | Description | Records |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `patients.csv` | Patient demographics and insurance details | 50 |
| `doctors.csv` | Doctor profiles and specialties | 10 |
| `appointments.csv` | Appointment details, reason for visit, status | 200 |
| `treatments.csv` | Treatment types, costs, and dates | 200 |
| `billing.csv` | Billing amounts, payment methods, and statuses | 200 |


## Performance Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Minimize Patient Waiting Time | Reduce time between registration and consultation. |
| Maximize Doctor Utilization | Ensure doctors’ schedules are efficiently filled without idle time. |
| Identify Bottlenecks in Registration Flow | Detect times or departments where patient flow slows down. |
| Improve Appointment Throughput | Increase the number of successfully completed appointments per day. |
| Optimize Resource Allocation | Balance patient loads across doctors and departments. |
| Reduce No-show Rate | Identify patterns behind missed appointments to improve scheduling accuracy. |
